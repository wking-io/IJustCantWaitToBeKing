    h3.story__subheading Perfect Timing...
    p.story__content 
      span “For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans for welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope.” Jeremiah 29:11 
    p.story__content You always read about God’s timing, but when you see Him working in your life, you begin to understand how perfect His plan is. If you had told us two years ago that we were getting married, we would promptly laughed and recommend you be institutionalized. But one Newk’s dinner and a little over a year later, we are here writing our story for you. 
    p.story__content Hey guys, Will here. When you are growing up you always believe that you will find the girl of your dreams. You think you will meet this girl, fireworks will go off and everything will be perfect. However, as life goes on that ideal slowly starts to fade and you think things do not really happen that way. Well let me tell you, Ali was exactly that girl. From the moment we began our friendship there was always something between us. The smiles, the communication we could have with just a look, it all seemed so easy. It was so natural I never gave it a second thought. That was until I had accepted a job in Birmingham and had three weeks until I was leaving Auburn for good. So I decided to go for it. 
    p.story__content Hey y’all, Ali’s turn. Ever since I was a little girl, I would always imagine what my future husband would be like. What would he look like? Did I already know him? What was his name? As a girl, it is easy to get caught up in all the details. So, I was at a point in my life where I thought it was best to take a break from dating. Needless to say, I was not looking for a relationship. Will and I have always been good friends, but that is all that it was— friends. He previously asked me to “catch up”, and I was still on my “I don’t need a man” kick so obviously I ignored him. A little time passed and he asked again, this time I kind of felt bad for ignoring his first offer so I decided to go. Words really can’t express just how thankful I am that I agreed to dinner. In a Newk’s in Auburn, Alabama I had my very first dinner with my future husband. 
    p.story__content The Newk’s date was perfect. Conversation was easy, jokes never stopped, and  Ali’s DJ skills were on point. Over the next two months our friendship grew. We took it slow and became better friends. We discussed our passions in life and most importantly our love for the Lord. Finally just one week before Will moved to Birmingham, we decided to give it everything we had to make long distance work.

    p.story__content Looking back, it is amazing to see the Lord’s hand through it all. God knew exactly what we needed, and He knew exactly who we needed. It was one month into our relationship, and we started finding old pictures that until now we hadn’t even given them a second thought. Pictures at football games, halloween parties, and the craziest of all the picture you see to your left. A year before we started dating, we went on a trip to South Carolina with some friends. We made a quick stop at a gas station for snacks, and we just happened to glance at the bottled cokes. At the very front there were two coke bottles next to each other— Will and Ali. Seriously. We didn’t move them. Both names are spelled correctly. It was right there in front of us. Will and Ali.  We laughed, thought it was neat, snapped a picture, and moved on.
    p.story__content Seeing that picture serves as a reminder to us that God’s plan and timing is greater than we ever imagined. We found our soulmate, we found our best friend, and we are incredibly blessed that we get to start our lives together glorifying our Father above in a few short months. It’s not the best love story, but it’s our favorite one.
